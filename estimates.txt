Since we have a Multi-AZ data base The minimum Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for a single AZ and single region Outage would the time required to detecting a 
failure in the source db and promoting a replica to master, writer or source database.

The minimum Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this single-AZ or single-region outage should be equivalent to the replica lag since it utilizes read replicas. 
The replica lag is the amount of time the replicais behind the source database. The replica lag varies with latency and the ammount of traffic.
